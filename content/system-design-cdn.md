</p>

A content delivery network (CDN) is a globally distributed network of proxy servers, serving content from locations closer to the user.  Generally, static files such as HTML/CSS/JS, photos, and videos are served from CDN, although some CDNs such as Amazon's CloudFront support dynamic content.  The site's DNS resolution will tell clients which server to contact.

Serving content from CDNs can significantly improve performance in two ways:

* Users receive content at data centers close to them
* Your servers do not have to serve requests that the CDN fulfills

### Push CDNs

Push CDNs receive new content whenever changes occur on your server.  You take full responsibility for providing content, uploading directly to the CDN and rewriting URLs to point to the CDN.  You can configure when content expires and when it is updated.  Content is uploaded only when it is new or changed, minimizing traffic, but maximizing storage.

Sites with a small amount of traffic or sites with content that isn't often updated work well with push CDNs.  Content is placed on the CDNs once, instead of being re-pulled at regular intervals.
